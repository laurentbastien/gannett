*A map that shows where Gannett stories actually originate.*

Project was made by scraping stories from Gannett newspapers in February 2017 and geo-coding them. Map shows the actual location of every newspaper vs. the "fictional" location of their content. For example, a story written by the Arizona Republic and published in the Arizona Republic was geo-coded to Phoenix, Arizona. A story published by the Ariona Republic but written by another outlet was geo-coded to the location of that outlet. 

The longer the line, the less original content the newspaper publishes.
